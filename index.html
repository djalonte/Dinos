<div> <p>The Abrictosaurus was a dinosaur that lived in the early Jurassic period of the Mesozoic era. It was a tiny dinosaur not weighing more than 40 to 50 kilos. It was during the middle of the Jurassic period that the large, dominant dinosaurs were seen on the earth. 
The Abrictosaurus was present on the planet about 200 to 195 million years ago. It is distinguished by the characteristic morphology of its teeth. Its teeth were developed to have more than one shape. This feature is not seen amongst the Triassic dinosaurs but is seen very commonly amongst the more evolved Jurassic dinosaurs. 
The fossils of the Abrictosaurus were discovered in southern Africa. It could have existed on South America as well since Africa and South America was a single continent in the Jurassic period. 
The Abrictosaurus belonged to order Orinithischia, which includes 'bird hipped' dinosaurs. It could walk on its hind legs, thus was bipedal. It derived its nourishment from plants and leaves.</p> </div>
